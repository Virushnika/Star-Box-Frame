This Java program prints a hollow square pattern using asterisks (*). It takes an integer n as input and uses nested loops to print the pattern. Asterisks are printed on the borders (first and last rows and columns), while spaces are printed inside to create the hollow effect. It demonstrates basic loops and conditionals.q
